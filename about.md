# About

At our cheatsheet repository, we use AI to augment our engineering productivity and enable us to produce high-quality and useful cheatsheets quickly. This revolution in the forces of production has allowed us to make a vast array of information available to engineers of all levels, distributed for free across the internet.

It's important to note that AI is not a magic bullet that will instantly produce high-quality output without any human intervention. Instead, engineers should view AI as a tool to be used alongside their existing knowledge and expertise. The best results are achieved when engineers fact-check the output of the AI, edit it to be more personable and human-like, and maintain the same code review standards as they would for human-created content.

We recognize that there are both right and wrong ways to use AI in engineering. Using AI as a standalone tool without human oversight can lead to incorrect or even harmful results. However, by using AI as a tool and combining it with human oversight, we can enhance our productivity and make more information available to the wider engineering community.

In addition to using AI responsibly, we believe that the open-source community can play a key role in increasing the quality of AI-augmented cheatsheets. By combining the knowledge and expertise of engineers across the globe, we can collaborate to create more comprehensive and accurate content.

We encourage our users to contribute to our cheatsheets, providing feedback, suggestions, and corrections. By doing so, we can work together to improve the quality of our content and ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date.

Furthermore, we believe that the open-source community can play a significant role in developing and improving AI models that are used to generate content. By making AI models open source and encouraging contributions from the community, we can ensure that they are thoroughly tested and vetted, leading to better results and reducing the potential for harm.

In summary, we believe that by combining the power of AI with the expertise of the open-source community, we can create high-quality cheatsheets that are accurate, up-to-date, and accessible to all. We encourage our users to get involved and contribute to our cheatsheets, ensuring that they remain a valuable resource for engineers around the world.

Thank you for visiting our cheatsheet website, and we hope that our content is useful to you in your engineering endeavors.
