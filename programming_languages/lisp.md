# Lisp Programming Language

Lisp is a family of programming languages that have been used in many applications over the years. It was originally developed in the late 1950s as a mathematical notation for computer programs and has since evolved into a general-purpose programming language. The latest stable version of Lisp is Common Lisp 21.2, released in December 2021.

## Variables

```lisp
(defvar variable value)    ; Define a variable
(setf variable value)      ; Set the value of a variable
(setq variable value)      ; Set the value of a variable
```

## Data Types

```lisp
;; Numbers
1
1.0
#b101                      ; binary
#c(1 2)                    ; complex

;; Strings
"hello, world!"

;; Characters
#\a

;; Lists
'(1 2 3)
(list 1 2 3)

;; Arrays
(make-array '(2 2) :initial-element 0)
```

## Control Structures

```lisp
;; Conditionals
(if test-form then-form [else-form])
(cond [test-form then-form] ...)

;; Loops
(dotimes (var count) body)
(dolist (var list) body)
(loop for var in list [for var2 in list2] [while condition] do body)
```

## Functions

```lisp
(defun name (args) body)     ; Define a function
(funcall function args)      ; Call a function with arguments
(apply function args)        ; Call a function with a list of arguments
(lambda (args) body)         ; Create an anonymous function
```

## Objects

```lisp
(defclass class-name [superclass-name] (slot-definition ...))
(make-instance class-name :slot-name value)
(slot-value object slot-name)
(setf (slot-value object slot-name) value)
```

## File I/O

```lisp
(with-open-file (var file-name :direction :input) body)
(with-open-file (var file-name :direction :output) body)
(write-line string file)
(format stream format-string &rest args)
```

## Error Handling

```lisp
(catch 'tag body)
(throw 'tag result)
(handler-bind ((condition-type handler-function)) body)
(ignore-errors body)
```
