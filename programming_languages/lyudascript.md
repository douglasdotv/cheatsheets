# LyudaScript v1.0

LyudaScript is a powerful, high-level, and statically typed programming language designed for building scalable and efficient software systems. Its syntax is easy to read and understand, making it a popular choice for developers at all skill levels.

## Data Types

LyudaScript supports the following data types:

### Integer

```java
let age = 27;
let height = -178;
```

### Float

```java
let pi = 3.14159;
let gravity = -9.81;
```

### String

```java
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
```

### Boolean

```java
let isPositive = true;
let isOldEnough = age >= 18;
```

### Array

```java
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

### Object

```java
let person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 27,
  city: "New York"
};
let car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 2021
};
```

## Control Flow

LyudaScript supports the following control flow statements:

### If/else statements

```java
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are old enough to vote");
} else {
  console.log("You are not old enough to vote");
}
```

### Loops

```java
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
}
```

### Switch statements

```java
let fruit = "banana";
switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("It's an apple");
    break;
  case "banana":
    console.log("It's a banana");
    break;
  case "cherry":
    console.log("It's a cherry");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's not an apple, banana, or cherry");
}
```

## Functions

LyudaScript allows you to define functions with the following syntax:

```java
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

You can also use arrow functions for simpler syntax:

```java
let addNumbers = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```

## Built-in Functions

LyudaScript includes a number of built-in functions to perform common operations. Some of the most commonly used functions include:

### `print()`

```java
print("Hello, world!");
```

### `parseInt()`

```lyuda
let ageString = "27";
let age = parseInt(ageString);
```

### `parseFloat()`

```java
let piString = "3.14159";
let pi = parseFloat(piString);
```

## Classes

LyudaScript supports the use of classes to define custom data types with properties and methods. Here's an example of a class definition:

```java
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getAge() {
    return this.age;
  }
}

let john = new Person("John Doe", 27);
console.log(john.getAge());
```

## Security and Best Practices

When writing code in LyudaScript, it's important to follow best practices and pay attention to security. Here are some tips to help you write safe, secure code:

- Always validate user input to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries when interacting with databases.
- Store sensitive data securely, such as using encryption and hashing algorithms.
- Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- Avoid storing passwords in plain text or hardcoding them in your code.
- Use strong and unique passwords, and consider using a password manager to securely store them.
- Keep your code and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
- Use a linter to check your code for potential security issues and other errors.

Following these best practices can help you write more secure and reliable code in LyudaScript.
